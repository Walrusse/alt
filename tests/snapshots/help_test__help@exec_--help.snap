alt-exec 
Run the given command

USAGE:
    alt exec <command> [command_args]...

ARGS:
    <command>            The command to run
    <command_args>...    Arguments to pass to the command

OPTIONS:
    -h, --help    Print help information

ARGS NOTE:
    Note that `alt exec` handles some flags on its own (`--help` for example).
    If you want to pass such arguments to the executed command instead of
    `alt exec`, you will need to use `--` to tell alt exec to stop parsing
    arguments.

    Example:

    alt exec node --help        # --help passed to alt (shows this message)
    alt exec node -- --help     # --help passed to node (shows node's help)
